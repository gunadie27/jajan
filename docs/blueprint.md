# **App Name**: Maujajan POS

## Core Features:

- Dashboard Overview: Clear dashboard presenting Key Performance Indicators with ability to filter the results
- POS Transaction Interface: Grid based UI for main POS interaction.
- User Role Management: Role-based access control
- Transaction Recording: Basic recording of income and expenses

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), evoking professionalism and reliability, referencing traditional big-brand 'tech' aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) creates a clean, uncluttered feel.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800) draws attention to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text; clean and readable fonts will improve usability of the interface, particularly in the transaction UI.
- Use Material Symbols for a consistent and modern look.
- A mobile-first approach adapting perfectly to both portrait (handheld) and landscape (tablet) orientations. Keep the design very simple.
- Subtle animations for UI feedback will acknowledge user interactions. Transitions between views should be very quick and lightweight so they don't interfere with POS operations.
